# Drag and Drop
Drag and Drop is a react web application which it accepts csv files and display the data related to the database file.

## Description
First you need to drop the file in the drop zone. It will use papaparse to parse the data. After that it will display a table containing countries(in my case)
(Note: You can change it to any data you want to display on the table.) After you need to select the country and drag to the another dropzone which it will appear after you drop the file in the first drop zone.
Then a table will be displayed containing the products list of the country which you selected. Next You need to select the products which you want to know about the details of the products.
After dragging it to the text area it will show all the data related to the country and the product you selected
